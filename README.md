## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [react-switch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-switch) - React component

### What I learned

Learned to handle CSS Grid better than before, and learned about context provider+custom hook design pattern in React

Learned to create CSS variables (my first time in a frontend project)


### Continued development

Would like to learn more about:
- React design patterns
- CSS animations
- And get familiar with UI libraries like Shadcn (since it was painful creating components from scratch)

### Useful resources

- [SVG Editor](https://www.svgviewer.dev/) - helped me in creating a dark mode header logo (since it's not included in the assets)
- [HSL to HEX](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex) - helped me convert given HSL colors to HEX since HSL isn't supported by the react-switch component
- [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) - used it to take full page screenshots
